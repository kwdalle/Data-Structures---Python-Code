chapter 116 dying whale


seldom life when side fortune's favourites
sail close adroop before catch
rushing breeze joyfully feel bagging sails fill out
pequod day encountering gay bachelor
whales slain ahab

afternoon spearings crimson
fight done floating lovely sunset sea sky sun
whale stilly died together then sweetness
plaintiveness inwreathing orisons curled rosy air
deep green convent valleys
manilla isles spanish land-breeze wantonly turned sailor
sea freighted vesper hymns

soothed again soothed deeper gloom ahab sterned
whale sat intently watching final wanings
tranquil boat strange spectacle observable sperm whales
dying--the turning sunwards head expiring--that strange
spectacle beheld placid evening ahab conveyed
wondrousness unknown before

turns turns it--how slowly steadfastly
homage-rendering invoking brow dying motions
worships fire faithful broad baronial vassal sun--oh
too-favouring eyes too-favouring sights
look here water-locked hum human weal woe
candid impartial seas traditions rocks
furnish tablets long chinese ages billows
rolled speechless unspoken stars shine
niger's unknown source here too life dies sunwards full faith
see sooner dead death whirls round corpse heads
way

dark hindoo half nature drowned bones hast builded
thy separate throne heart unverdured seas
art infidel queen speakest
wide-slaughtering typhoon hushed burial calm
thy whale sunwards turned dying head round
again lesson

trebly hooped welded hip power high aspiring rainbowed
jet--that strivest jettest vain vain
whale dost seek intercedings yon all-quickening sun
calls life again dost thou darker
half rock prouder darker faith thy unnamable
imminglings float beneath here buoyed breaths living
things exhaled air water now

then hail hail sea eternal tossings wild
fowl finds rest born earth suckled sea
hill valley mothered billows foster-brothers

waif-pole thrust upright dead whale's spout-hole
lantern hanging top cast troubled flickering glare

chapter 128 pequod meets rachel


day large ship rachel descried bearing directly
pequod spars thickly clustering men
time pequod making good speed water
broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh her boastful sails
fell blank bladders burst life fled

bad news brings bad news muttered manxman ere
commander who trumpet mouth stood boat ere
hopefully hail ahab's voice heard

hast white whale

aye yesterday whale-boat adrift

throttling joy ahab negatively answered unexpected question
fain boarded stranger stranger captain
himself stopped vessel's way descending

ahab nantucketer knew formal salutation exchanged

where he--not killed--not killed cried ahab closely advancing

late afternoon day previous
three stranger's boats engaged shoal whales
led miles ship
swift chase windward white hump head moby dick
suddenly loomed water leeward whereupon
fourth rigged boat--a reserved one--had instantly lowered
chase keen sail wind fourth boat--the swiftest
keeled all--seemed succeeded fastening--at least
well man mast-head
distance diminished dotted boat swift gleam
bubbling white water more
concluded stricken whale indefinitely
pursuers happens apprehension
positive alarm yet recall signals rigging
darkness forced pick three windward
boats--ere going quest fourth precisely opposite
direction--the ship necessitated leave boat
fate till midnight but time increase distance
rest crew safe aboard crowded

try-pots beacon man aloft look-out

apart parallel lines sweeping double horizon were

will wager now whispered stubb flask that

watch--he's cursed anxious back heard
pious whale-ships cruising missing whale-boat height
whaling season see flask pale looks--pale

his son cried stubb it's son he's lost
coat watch--what ahab save boy

he's drowned rest 'em night manx
sailor standing them heard heard spirits

now shortly turned out incident rachel's
melancholy circumstance
captain's sons number missing boat's crew
number boat's crews time
hand separated ship dark vicissitudes chase
son time wretched
father plunged bottom cruellest perplexity
solved chief mate's instinctively adopting
ordinary procedure whale-ship emergencies
jeopardized divided boats pick

refrained mentioning this till forced
ahab's iciness allude missing boy lad
twelve years old father earnest unmisgiving

initiate perils wonders vocation immemorially

nantucket captains will send son tender age them
protracted three years' voyage ship

partiality undue apprehensiveness concern

meantime stranger beseeching poor boon ahab
ahab stood anvil receiving shock

hurriedly turning averted face descended cabin
leaving strange captain transfixed unconditional utter
rejection earnest suit starting enchantment

ships diverged wakes long strange vessel

small sea yards swung round

intense pequod sailed rolling waves days
life-buoy-coffin lightly swung ship miserably
misnamed delight descried drew nigh eyes
fixed broad beams called shears which whaling-ships
cross quarter-deck height feet serving
carry spare unrigged disabled boats

stranger's shears beheld shattered white ribs
splintered planks whale-boat
wreck plainly peeled
half-unhinged bleaching skeleton horse

hast white whale

look replied hollow-cheeked captain taffrail
trumpet pointed wreck

hast killed him

the harpoon forged will that answered
other sadly glancing rounded hammock deck gathered
sides noiseless sailors busy sewing together

not forged snatching perth's levelled iron crotch ahab
held out exclaiming--look nantucketer hand hold
death tempered blood tempered lightning barbs
swear temper triply hot place fin
white whale feels accursed life

then god thee man--see'st that--pointing

yesterday dead ere night bury rest
buried died sail tomb turning
crew--are ready there place plank rail
lift body then--oh god--advancing hammock
uplifted hands--may resurrection life--

brace forward helm cried ahab lightning men

suddenly started pequod quick escape sound
splash corpse struck sea
quick indeed flying bubbles sprinkled

hanging pequod's stern conspicuous relief

yonder yonder men cried foreboding voice wake
vain strangers fly sad burial turn

chapter 135 chase--third day


morning third day dawned fair fresh
solitary night-man fore-mast-head relieved crowds
daylight look-outs dotted mast spar

d'ye him cried ahab whale sight

infallible wake though follow wake that's all helm

fairer day dawn world here's food thought
ahab time think ahab thinks feels feels feels
that's tingling mortal man think's audacity god
privilege thinking coolness
calmness poor hearts throb poor brains beat
that yet thought brain calm--frozen
calm skull cracks glass contents
turned ice shiver hair growing now
moment growing heat breed it's sort
common grass will grow anywhere earthy clefts
greenland ice vesuvius lava wild winds blow whip
torn shreds split sails lash tossed ship
cling vile wind doubt blown ere prison
corridors cells wards hospitals ventilated them
blowing innocent fleeces it--it's
tainted wind i'd blow wicked miserable
world i'd crawl cave slink there yet 'tis
noble heroic thing wind conquered fight
bitterest blow tilting
coward wind strikes stark naked men will
stand receive single blow ahab braver thing--a nobler
thing that wind body things
exasperate outrage mortal man things
bodiless bodiless objects agents there's
special cunning malicious difference yet
again swear now there's glorious
gracious wind warm trade winds least
clear heavens blow straight strong steadfast vigorous
mildness veer mark baser currents
sea turn tack mightiest mississippies land swift
swerve about uncertain last eternal
poles trades directly blow good ship
trades them--something unchangeable full
strong blow keeled soul along aloft there d'ye see

but ahab thy shot fell short good-bye mast-head--keep good
eye whale i'm gone talk to-morrow nay
to-night white whale lies there tied head tail

word gazing round him steadily lowered
cloven blue air deck

heart wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing side
eyes receding boat--canst ring boldly

three days flow continuous intense pursuit
morning second noon third evening

mark well whale--ho again--drive hawk see pecks--he

silence head-beat waves hammered hammered

suddenly waters slowly swelled broad circles
upheaved sideways sliding submerged berg
ice swiftly rising surface low rumbling sound heard
subterraneous hum held breaths bedraggled
trailing ropes harpoons lances vast form shot lengthwise
obliquely sea shrouded thin drooping veil mist

fagged three days' running chase resistance

latent deceitfulness malice him whichever true white
whale's began abate seemed boat rapidly
nearing more whale's start
long before ahab glided waves
unpitying sharks accompanied him pertinaciously stuck
boat continually bit plying oars blades
jagged crunched left small splinters sea

'tis better rest shark's jaw yielding water

but bite sir thin blades grow smaller smaller

they will long enough pull on--but tell--he
muttered--whether sharks swim feast whale
ahab--but pull aye alive now--we him helm
helm pass--and oarsmen helped forward

hearing tremendous rush sea-crashing boat whale wheeled

oarsmen violently forced boat
